Support areas for IGWN include data management, infrastructure (StashCaches, FTS service for Rucio managed third-party transfers), best practices for software and job management, and in-person participation in the Open Science - LIGO weekly meetings. The LIGO component of the IGWN collaboration has 61 institutions and universities in the US that make use of the Open Science distributed infrastructure for computing. LIGO is supported by the NSF award # PHY-2110594 for the LIGO Data Grid (LDG) and NSF award # PHY-1764464 for the LIGO Lab in computing, R&D, and operations. During the month of January - in general a low production job volume period - LIGO consumed 33k core hours in payload jobs compared to 100k core hours during the previous period. A detailed list of technical contacts and leads for the various workloads is maintained by the LIGO and Open Science group here. For general purpose data and job management, the lead is: James Clark james.clark@ligo.org
