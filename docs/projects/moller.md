## MOLLER

The Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction is a proposed high energy physics experiment at JLAB. A pilot project for jobs at the Open Science fabric is already in place on the OSG Connect infrastructure. The main focus for the collaboration at the moment is to carry out extensive simulations that will further validate the detector design. 
There is no overall project or data management person for the Moller experiment at this point. The PI is Prof Wouter Deconick Wouter.Deconinck@umanitoba.ca
